RaspberryPi-for-Vision-Application-
===================================
Get know Raspberry Pi with python-openCV interface and its installation procedure.

Experience With RPI to share: 

 Well working with Raspberry Pi is really awesome.I picked up a Raspberry Pi some months back without much of a need for it. Most of my electronics stuff is bought without a use, so I guess it's no surprise this time. I ended up ordering what is called the ModelB, which is the earlier model with 256MB of RAM. To be honest, I didn't really even know what the hell the board did, I just heard other tech ppls babble on about how it was going to revolutionize home computing. Since it's a full computer, not just a microcontroller.
  I have spent the past few months knowing this tech RPI and python full time, instead of just when I was told to work with some custom ARM boards for my college projects and where I was required to know enough mathematical interpretation of signal image computing algorithms in "C" to keep my project up and running. I've always liked Matlab cause of its highly computing ability with easy codebility. So for me it was really a point of attraction when I heard of python interpretor support for Raspbian OS.
